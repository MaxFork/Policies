* Upon reasonable and timely advance agreement, during regular business hours and without interrupting Courier’s business operations, conduct an on-site inspection of Courier’s business operations or have the same conducted by a qualified third party which shall not be a competitor of Courier.

Courier shall, upon Customer’s written request and within a reasonable period of time, provide Customer with all information necessary for such audit, to the extent that such information is within Processor’s control and Courier is not precluded from disclosing it by applicable law, a duty of confidentiality, or any other obligation owed to a third party.

## 7. Data transfers

For transfers of EU Personal Data to Courier for processing by Courier in a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in the EU, the EEA, or the European Commission-approved countries providing ‘adequate’ data protection, Courier agrees it will:

* provide at least the same level of privacy protection for EU Personal Data as required under the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield frameworks;
* use the form of the Controller-to-Processor SCCs adopted by the EU Commission.

If data transfers under Section 7 of this DPA rely on Controller-to-Processor SCCs to enable the lawful transfer of EU Personal Data, as set forth in the preceding sentence, the parties agree that data subjects for whom a Courier entity processes EU Personal Data are third-party beneficiaries under the Controller-to-Processor SCCs. If Courier is unable or becomes unable to comply with these requirements, then EU Personal Data will be processed and used exclusively within the territory of a member state of the European Union and any movement of EU Personal Data to a non-EU country requires the prior written consent of Customer. Courier shall promptly notify Customer of any inability by Courier to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.

## 8. Data return and deletion

The parties agree that on the termination of the data processing services or upon Customer’s reasonable request, Courier shall, and shall cause any Subprocessors to, at the choice of Customer, return all the Customer Personal Data and copies of such data to Customer or securely destroy them and demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures, unless Data Protection Requirements prevent Courier from returning or destroying all or part of the Customer Personal Data disclosed. In such case, Courier agrees to preserve the confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data retained by it and that it will only actively process such Customer Personal Data after such date in order to comply with applicable laws.

## 9. Third party data processors

Customer acknowledges that in the provision of some services, Courier, on receipt of instructions from Customer, may transfer Customer Personal Data to and otherwise interact with third party data processors.

Customer agrees that if and to the extent such transfers occur, Customer is responsible for entering into separate contractual arrangements with such third party data processors binding them to comply with obligations in accordance with Data Protection Requirements.

For the avoidance of doubt, such third party data processors are not Subprocessors.

## 10. Term

This DPA shall remain in effect as long as Courier carries out Personal Data processing operations on behalf of Customer or until the termination of the Courier Agreement (and all Personal Data has been returned or deleted in accordance with Section 8 above).

## 11. Governing law, jurisdition and venue

Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, this DPA shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA and any action or proceeding related to this DPA (including those arising from non contractual disputes or claims) will be decided by the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware, and each party will be subject to the jurisdiction of those courts.
