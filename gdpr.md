# Courier's GDPR Compliance

The EU [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (GDPR) came into effect on May 25, 2018. Courier is compliant.

## Does GDPR affect me?

If you're based in the EU or do business in the EU, yeah! GDPR has a long reach. If you have [any EU personal data in your Courier account](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/), such as names, email addresses, ID numbers, or anything personally identifiable, then GDPR applies. You are a Controller of personal data under GDPR, so you need to enter into GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with any online services and third party vendors you rely on, including Courier. These agreements are commonly called a Data Processing Addendum, or DPA.

## Data Processing Addendum

Contracts required! Processing EU personal data must be governed by a [GDPR-compliant contract](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). We provide a standard Data Processing Addendum (DPA) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed [upon request](mailto:support@trycourier.com).

Courier participates in the [EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework](privacy-shield.md) to safeguard the transfer of personal data to the US, meeting the GDPR requirement for adequate data protection laws.

## Subprocessors

Courier uses third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to provide our services. [List of Courier subprocessors](subprocessors.md).
